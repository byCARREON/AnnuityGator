### Overall Time
The total time invested in completing the landing page was approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes.

## Building Approach
The landing page was built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The decision to use React.js was made to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, while Tailwind CSS allowed for fast development and ensured a consistent and responsive design across devices.

The project structure was organized into reusable components to improve code maintainability and readability while focusing on mobile-first development. The use of Tailwind CSS utility classes significantly reduced the need for custom CSS styles, saving development time. 

### Any Other Information
During the development process, I encountered some challenges related to form validation and responsive design. Therefore, I successfully implemented form validation to ensure that all mandatory fields are completed before form submission.

The responsive design was thoroughly tested across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Overall, the project was a great opportunity to show my frontend skills and best practices to deliver a high-quality landing page.
